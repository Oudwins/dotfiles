.SH CONFIG FILES
.SS /etc/dmscripts/config
.PP
This is considered the official global config file and we do not
recommend you editing it.
It will be overwritten if we change the configuration so you\[aq]ll need
to back it up if you modify it
.SS \[ti]/.config/dmscripts/config
.PP
The first local config file is found here, this is free to modify and it
is the recommended way to change the config file as it does not get
overwritten.
It is worth noting however that the config is still regularly modified
so you will have to keep up to date on our gitlab page and read the
diffs.
.SS Using the repo configuration
.PP
The repo can be used as is and provides a local config file.
You can change it but it\[aq]s change at your own risk.
If you want to update the repo, for example, there may be merge
conflicts.
And when commiting, we expect a default config unless you are
intentionally making changes to fix a bug or make an update and not to
simply change something in a way you prefer.
.SS Using global variables
.PP
While we don\[aq]t recommend it, you can choose to set some variables in
other places such as the bashrc or the /etc/profile file.
.SS Modifying the source
.PP
Finally, you can modify the source code to add more files to modify or
to customize dmscripts to your heart\[aq]s content, please report any
bugs along the way however.
Confirm it on an unmodified version first and read the issues.
.SH CONFIGURATION
.SS DMENU variable
.PP
DMENU is the default variable used in dmscripts, we expect all scripts
to use DMENU in substitution of the dmenu command as we want our scripts
to be accessible without modifying the source code.
Currently DMENU is defined in a case statement which is used to define
DMENU differently depending on the script.
.SS Other variables
.PP
A lot of the other variables are simply program names or directories and
are not worth going into further details.
.SS Lists
.PP
Some our config is done in a list like format.
There are two syntaxes, -A and -a.
.PP
-A uses the format of:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
variable[name-displayed-in-dmenu]=what-it-actually-means
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
-a uses:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
variable=(
\[dq]thing1\[dq]
\[dq]thing2\[dq]
\&...
)
\f[R]
.fi
